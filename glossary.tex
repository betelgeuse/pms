\chapter{Glossary}
\label{glossary}

This section contains explanations of some of the terms used in this document whose meaning may not
be immediately obvious.

\begin{description}
\item[qualified package name] A package name along with its associated category. For example,
    \t{app-editors/vim} is a qualified package name.
\item[old-style virtual] An old-style virtual is a psuedo-package which exists if it is listed in an
    ebuild's \t{PROVIDE} variable. See chapter \ref{old-style-virtuals}.
\item[new-style virtual] A new-style virtual is a normal package in the \t{virtual} category which
    installs no files and uses its dependency requirements to pull in a `provider'. This is more
    flexible than the old-style virtuals described above, and requires no special package manager
    code.
