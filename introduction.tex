\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Aims and Motivation}

This document aims to fully describe the format of an ebuild repository and the ebuilds therein, as
well as certain aspects of package manager behaviour required to support such a repository.

This document is \i{not} designed to be an introduction to ebuild development. Prior knowledge of
ebuild creation and an understanding of how the package management system works is assumed; certain
less familiar terms are explained in the Glossary in chapter~\ref{glossary}.

This document does not specify any user or package manager configuration information.

\section{Rationale}

At present the only definition of what an ebuild can assume about its environment,
and the only definition of what is valid in an ebuild, is the source code of the latest Portage release
and a general consensus about which features are too new to assume availability. This has several
drawbacks: not only is it impossible to change any aspect of Portage behaviour without verifying
that nothing in the tree relies upon it, but if a new package manager should appear it becomes
impossible to fully support such an ill-defined standard.

This document aims to address both of these concerns by defining almost all aspects of what an
ebuild repository looks like, and how an ebuild is allowed to behave. Thus, both Portage and other
package managers can change aspects of their behaviour not defined here without worry of
incompatibilities with any particular repository.

\section{Conventions}

Text in \t{teletype} is used for filenames or variable names. \i{Italic} text is used for terms
with a particular technical meaning in places where there may otherwise be ambiguity.

The term \i{package manager} is used throughout this document in a broad sense. Although some parts
of this document are only relevant to fully featured package managers, many items are equally
applicable to tools or other applications that interact with ebuilds or ebuild repositories.

\section{EAPIs}

An EAPI can be thought of as a `version' of this specification to which a package conforms. An EAPI
value is a string (all EAPIs defined by this specification currently use an integer, but package
managers must not assume that this will hold in the future, and package managers must not assume
that any kind of comparison other than equality between EAPI values makes sense). There are two
EAPIs defined by this specification:

\begin{description}
\item[0] The `original' base EAPI.
\item[1] EAPI `1' contains a number of extensions to EAPI `0'. Except where explicitly noted, it is
    in all other ways identical to EAPI `0'.
\end{description}

Except where explicitly noted, everything in this specification applies to both EAPIs.

If a package manager encounters a package version with an unrecognised EAPI, it must not attempt to
perform any operations upon it. It could, for example, ignore the package version entirely (although
this can lead to user confusion), or it could mark the package version as masked. A package manager
must not use any metadata generated from a package with an unrecognised EAPI.

EAPIs whose value consists purely of an integer are reserved for future versions of this
specification. EAPIs whose value starts with the string \t{paludis-} are reserved for experimental
use by the Paludis package manager.
