\section{Profile variables}
\label{sec:profile-variables}

This section documents variables that have special meaning, or special behaviour, when defined in a
profile's \t{make.defaults} file.

\subsection{Incremental Variables}
\i{Incremental} variables must stack between parent and child profiles in the following manner:
Beginning with the highest parent profile, tokenise the variable's value based on whitespace and
concatenate the lists. Then, for any token $T$ beginning with a hyphen, remove it and any previous
tokens whose value is equal to $T$ with the hyphen removed, or, if $T$ is equal to \t{-*}, remove
all previous values. Note that because of this treatment, the order of tokens in the final result is
arbitrary, not necessarily related to the order of tokens in any given profile. The following
variables must be treated in this fashion:
\begin{compactitem}
\item \t{USE}
\item \t{USE\_EXPAND}
\item \t{USE\_EXPAND\_HIDDEN}
\item \t{CONFIG\_PROTECT}
\item \t{CONFIG\_PROTECT\_MASK}
\end{compactitem}

Other variables, except where they affect only package-manager-specific functionality (such as
Portage's \t{FEATURES} variable), must not be treated incrementally---later definitions shall
completely override those in parent profiles.

\subsection{Specific variables and their meanings}
The following variables have specific meanings when set in profiles.
\begin{description}
\item[ARCH] The system's architecture. Must be a value listed in \t{profiles/arch.list}; see
    section~\ref{arch.list} for more information. Must be equal to the primary \t{KEYWORD} for this
    profile.
\item[CONFIG\_PROTECT, CONFIG\_PROTECT\_MASK] Contain whitespace-delimited lists used to control the
    configuration file protection. Described more fully in chapter~\ref{sec:config-protect}.
\item[USE] Defines the list of default USE flags for this profile. Flags may be added or removed by
    the user's configuration. \t{USE\_EXPAND} values must not be specified in this way.
\item[USE\_EXPAND] Defines a list of variables which are to be treated incrementally and whose
    contents are to be expanded into the USE variable as passed to ebuilds. See
    section~\ref{sec:use-iuse-handling} for details.
\item[USE\_EXPAND\_HIDDEN] Contains a (possibly empty) subset of names from \t{USE\_EXPAND}. The
    package manager may use this set as a hint to avoid displaying uninteresting or unhelpful
    information to an end user.
\end{description}

Any other variables set in \t{make.defaults} must be passed on into the ebuild environment as-is,
and are not required to be interpreted by the package manager.
