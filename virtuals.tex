\chapter{Old-Style Virtual Packages}
\label{old-virtuals}

Old-style virtuals are pseudo-packages---they can be depended upon or installed, but do not exist
in the ebuild repository. This is in contrast to \i{new-style} virtuals, which are simply ebuilds in
the \t{virtual} category which install no files and use their dependency strings to select
providers. An old-style virtual requires several things in the repository: at least
one ebuild must list the virtual, whose category must always be \t{virtual}, in its \t{PROVIDE}
variable, and there must be at least one entry in a profiles \t{virtuals} file listing the default
provider for each profile---see sections \ref{ebuild-var-provide} and \ref{profiles-virtuals} for
specifics on these two. Old-style virtuals require special handling as regards dependencies; this is
described below.

\section{Dependencies on virtual packages}

When a dependency on a virtual package is encountered, it must be resolved into a real package
before it can be satisfied. There are two factors that affect this process: whether a package
providing the virtual is installed, and the \t{virtuals} file in the active profile (section
\ref{profiles-virtuals}). If a package is already installed which satisfies the virtual requirement
(via \t{PROVIDE}), then it should be used to satisfy the dependency. Otherwise, the profiles
\t{virtuals} file (section \ref{profiles-virtuals}) should be consulted to choose an appropriate
provider.

Dependencies on old style virtuals may not use any kind of version restriction.

Blocks on provided virtuals have special behaviour documented in section \ref{provided-blocks}.
